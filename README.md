Description in one line: Linear time complexity sorting of integer numbers(C/C++ Challenge from Envio).

Coding Task - Abstract
==================================================================================================================================
Sort an array of 0s, 1s and 2s in linear time complexity, like this one:
1 int o [ 30 ] = { 2 , 2 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 2 , 2 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 2 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 ,
1 , 2 };
Description
Given an array consisting only 0s, 1s and 2s, please provide an algorithm sorting that array in
O(n) time complexity. So in the resulting sorted array, 0s will be at starting, then the 1s & then the
2s.
● The usage of built-ins or libraries, like std::sort or boost::sort is not allowed.
● Coding style and quality is more important than feature completeness.
● What to submit: A git repository of the work and all commits made on the way.

Environment
===================================================================================================================================
Used the following online C compiler to compile and test the C code.

Assumptions while running the program
===================================================================================================================================
Rule1: User should enter three different integer values multiple times, extra integers will not store/sort.
Rule2: Characters other than integer will not store/sort.
Rule3: Each integers should be separated by one space bar and after entering all the integer values press the enter key.
